# Diabetic Retinopathy Image Classification

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the classification of retinal images to determine the presence of diabetic retinopathy. The model achieves an accuracy of 93.5% in distinguishing between diabetic retinopathy positive and negative cases, providing a valuable tool for early detection and intervention in diabetic patients.



## Features
- High accuracy of 93.5% in classifying retinal images.
- User-friendly web application built with Streamlit for easy image upload and classification.
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
- Detailed performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Keras for image processing
- Streamlit for web application development
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation

## Dataset
The dataset consists of retinal images labeled as diabetic retinopathy positive or negative. The images were sourced from publicly available datasets, ensuring a diverse range of samples for effective model training.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for image classification tasks. Key components include:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.
- Fully connected layers for final classification.
